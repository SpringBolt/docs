## What are J2EE Patterns?

**Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)** patterns are specific architectural solutions for problems commonly faced in enterprise web applications.

While the original "Gang of Four" (GoF) patterns focus on general object-oriented design, J2EE patterns focus on the **Presentation**, **Business**, and **Integration** tiers of a distributed application.

Many of these patterns form the underlying architecture of modern frameworks like **Spring Boot**. Understanding them explains _how_ Spring works under the hood.

### Presentation Tier

This tier handles the interaction with the user (UI) and the initial processing of requests.

    The standard architecture for web applications, separating data, UI, and logic.
</Card>

<Card
    title="Front Controller"

    arrow="true"

>
    A single entry point for all requests (the concept behind Spring's DispatcherServlet).
</Card>

<Card
    title="Intercepting Filter"

    arrow="true"
    horizontal
>
    Pluggable filters for pre/post-processing requests (the concept behind Spring Security).
</Card>

### Business Tier

This tier hosts the application's business logic and transactions.

<Card
    title="Business Delegate"
    icon="briefcase"
    href="./business-delegate/business-delegate"
    arrow="true"
    horizontal
>
    Decouples the client from business services to hide the complexity of remote lookups.
</Card>

<Card
    title="Service Locator"
    icon="search-location"
    href="./service-locator/service-locator"
    arrow="true"
    horizontal
>
    Centralizes and caches the lookup of expensive service objects.
</Card>

### Integration Tier

This tier manages connections to databases, legacy systems, and external services.

<Card
    title="Data Access Object (DAO)"
    icon="database"
    href="./data-access-object/data-access-object"
    arrow="true"
    horizontal
>
    Abstracts and encapsulates all access to the data source.
</Card>
<Card
    title="Data Transfer Object (DTO)"
    icon="truck-loading"
    href="./data-transfer-object/data-transfer-object"
    arrow="true"
    horizontal
>
    An object used to carry data between processes to reduce the number of method calls.
</Card>

## Summary Table

| Pattern | Scope | Core Function | Modern Spring Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MVC** | Architecture | Separates UI, Data, and Logic. | `@RestController`, `@Controller` |
| **Front Controller** | Presentation | Centralized entry point for requests. | `DispatcherServlet` |
| **Intercepting Filter** | Presentation | Pre/Post-processing of requests. | `Filter`, Spring Security Chain |
| **Business Delegate** | Business | Decouples client from services. | `@Autowired` (Dependency Injection) |
| **Service Locator** | Business | Caches service lookups. | `ApplicationContext` (Spring IoC Container) |
| **DAO** | Data | Abstracts data persistence logic. | `JpaRepository` (Spring Data JPA) |
| **DTO** | Data | Carries data between processes. | `record` (Java) / POJO |

## Advantages of J2EE Patterns

* **Standardization**: They provide a shared vocabulary and standard approach for developers to solve common enterprise problems.
* **Separation of Concerns**: By dividing the application into Tiers (Presentation, Business, Integration), code becomes easier to maintain and test.
* **Performance Optimization**: Patterns like *Service Locator* and *DTO* are specifically designed to reduce network traffic and latency in distributed systems.
* **Decoupling**: Patterns like *Business Delegate* and *DAO* ensure that if the database or business logic changes, the front-end code remains unaffected.
* **Security**: Centralized patterns like *Front Controller* and *Intercepting Filter* ensure that security checks are applied consistently across the application.

## When to Use J2EE Patterns

* **Building Frameworks**: If you are building a web framework from scratch, these are the fundamental building blocks you will need.
* **Understanding Legacy Code**: Many legacy banking and enterprise systems are explicitly built on these patterns without using modern frameworks.
* **Mastering Spring/Jakarta EE**: To truly understand *why* Spring behaves the way it does, you must understand the J2EE patterns it abstracts away.
* **Complex Enterprise Systems**: When building distributed systems where network overhead and resource management are critical concerns.

## Conclusion

While the explicit implementation of "J2EE" (now Jakarta EE) has evolved, the patterns themselves remain timeless. They are the architectural foundation of almost all modern Java web development.
