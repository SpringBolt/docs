### What is Core Java?

Core Java refers to the standard edition (J2SE) of the Java language. It is the foundation upon which all other Java technologies (like Java EE, Spring, or Android) are built.

It covers the basic concepts, language syntax, and libraries required to develop general-purpose applications.

The philosophy of Java is **"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA)**, meaning compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
