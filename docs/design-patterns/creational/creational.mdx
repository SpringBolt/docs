### Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

They solve the problem of creating objects in a suitable manner for the situation, rather than instantiating objects directly which can lead to inflexible code.

### Quick Comparison Table

| Pattern | Core Concept | Key Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Singleton](./singleton-pattern/singleton-pattern/) | Restricts class to one instance | Ensures a single point of access/control (e.g., Database connection). |
| [Factory Method](./factory-method-pattern/factory-method-pattern/) | Interface for creating objects | Allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. |
| [Abstract Factory](./abstract-factory-pattern/abstract-factory-pattern/) | Families of related objects | Creates compatible groups of objects without specifying their concrete classes. |
| [Builder](./builder-pattern/builder-pattern/) | Step-by-step construction | Constructs complex objects clearly and separates construction from representation. |
| [Prototype](./prototype-pattern/prototype-pattern/) | Copying existing objects | Efficiently creates new objects by cloning an existing instance. |
