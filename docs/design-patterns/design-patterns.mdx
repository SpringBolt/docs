### What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable, proven solutions to common problems that occur during software design.

They are not finished pieces of code that can be transformed directly into a program; rather, they are templates or best practices that describe how to solve a problem in a way that is efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

Think of them as **blueprints** for solving recurring architectural challenges, allowing developers to communicate using a shared vocabulary and avoid "reinventing the wheel."
