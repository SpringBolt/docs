## 📖 About The Project

SpringBolt is designed as a quick reference guide and learning hub for developers. It is ideal for revision, learning new concepts, and preparing for technical interviews. The content ranges from core syntax to advanced software design topics.

## 🎯 Goal of this Repository

This repository serves as a quick reference guide for:

* **Revision:** Quick recaps of concepts before interviews.
* **Snippets:** Copy-paste ready code for standard algorithms and patterns.
* **Deep Dives:** Explaining the "why" behind program behavior.
* **Structured Notes:** Organized content for linear reading or reference.

## 📚 Topics Covered

The documentation is organized into major technical distinct tracks:

### ☕ Java

A deep dive into the fundamentals and object-oriented programming:

* **OOPs Concepts:** Classes & Objects, Enums, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Relationships.

### 🧩 Design Patterns

Comprehensive coverage of the 23 GoF Design Patterns:

* **Creational:** Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.
* **Structural:** Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy.
* **Behavioral:** Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor.

### 🛠️ J2EE Patterns

Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) patterns are specific architectural solutions for problems commonly faced in enterprise web applications.

While the original “Gang of Four” (GoF) patterns focus on general object-oriented design, J2EE patterns focus on the Presentation, Business, and Integration tiers of a distributed application.
